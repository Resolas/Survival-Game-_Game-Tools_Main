# Survival-Game-_Game-Tools_Main
The main repository for game project


This is a student game project

This is a survival game, with randomly generated supermassive structures towering into the sky, the structures are composed of various
modules, consisting of multiple floors, rooms and hallways which contains loot for the player to collect, each module are essentially its
own level/map, which the player has to explore and not get caught by scouting drones that spawns in them.

There are drones scattered across the deserted wasteland, drones with red lights are often bad news, avoid them or destroy them quickly!
Loot is occasionally spawned amongst the rubble out in the open wasteland aside from towering buildings
